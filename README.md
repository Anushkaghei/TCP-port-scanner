## ABSTRACT

The project is a Python script that implements a basic port scanning tool. The script allows the user to input a host IP address, a range of ports to scan, and a scan type (TCP, UDP, SYN, or FIN). It then performs a scan using the specified scan type on each port in the range and records the number of open ports and the time taken for each scan. The results are displayed in the console and saved to a CSV file.

Useful for network administrators and security professionals who need to quickly identify open ports and vulnerabilities on a target system.
